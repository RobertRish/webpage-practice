- Setup an external stylesheet (.css file) and link to it in the head of the page (bonus: if you are familiar with SASS, setup partials as you go that compile to a main css file, and link to the main css file in the head; share any SASS partials in your final assessment ZIP folder)
- Connect the Google font "Open Sans" in the head of the page, and configure your CSS to use the font family
- Translate the below into valid CSS:
	- Base body font: 18px, black
	- H2 (headline): 25px, black, bold
	- Buttons / links: 18px, #f01e5c, change to 0.7 opacity on hover
- Use the provided wireframe (labeled Web Developer Wireframe.png) to put together a simple homepage layout. Use a 1100px wide body container with 15px of padding on each side. Navigation links can simply link to https://google.com. Header and block images have been provided within this folder.
- Implement the above as a responsive design. Using flexbox, update the section with 4 columns to display as 2 rows of 2 columns on tablet, then fully stacked (1 item per row) on mobile. 
- Configure an external Javascript (JS) file. In it, do the following:
	- On form submit button click, print the entered input to the page in a paragraph tag below the form. This can be done either using vanilla Javascript or jQuery (if using jQuery, load via CDN through https://releases.jquery.com/).
	- If the form submit button is clicked without valid input, display an error message in red below the form.
